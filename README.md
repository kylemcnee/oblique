# Oblique Strategies



Oblique Strategies was originally conceived as a deck of 2.8 in × 3.5 in printed cards in a black container box, created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt and first published in 1975. Each card offers a challenging constraint intended to help artists (particularly musicians) break creative blocks by encouraging lateral thinking.  This is an Android app version of the original Oblique Strategies deck. It was developed using Kotlin, a language intended to make Android development more streamlined and lightweight.  The minimalism offered by coding in Kotlin compared to Java served as an inspiration for both the concept and design of this app.
